<h1>First Image Before and After</h1>

<p>In the first image of the tap, I found that the original was extremely bland. Lots of muddy colors were present and the lighting in the room didn’t help to make the object pop. I love color and turned up the saturation and contrast to really make the blue shine. The reason why I zoomed in was to get rid of the muddy-ness in the background. I tweaked the shadows to drop their yellows a little bit, and adjusted the red highlights so they weren’t overbearing. I kept the fire hydrant in the image to give some contrast to the blue, and because symbolically it makes sense as I create a theme of going against fire.</p>
