<p>In the second image, I loved that the message was right in your face and didn’t hold back. And so I wanted to emphasize that punch, adjusting the highlights to make the whites cooler. I added a light vignette in addition to block out everything else and center on the pink poster. I originally took the image at a canted angle to illustrate the “impact” of the viewer, but also to create a space for critical thinking as they examine the poster by tilting their head.</p>
