<h1>Homework 2 First Reflection</h1>
<p>I believe photography and image making is fundamental to this world both as an art form and a craft. So many inspiring pieces can be created, captured and altered, whether the reason is to elicit new meaning or build upon what was already understood. I primarily use photography as a means to cling to nostalgia, a feeling that humans often have a hard time ignoring. Whenever I’m out with my friends for a quick hangout or a long planned day, I often take photos throughout the day to commemorate those memories and look back on the time we spent together and the fun we had. Most of the time, the photos (and videos) are funny moments, which we send to each other to brighten up moods. One particular example is when we take a photo and make a sticker from it, which on its own pushes this idea of image making as an art form because the sticker we post is the original image altered. When we send these to make each other laugh, this illustrates the craft of image making, and how photography is important for the relationships we have.</p>
<p>Susan Sontag in her book On Photography describes how photography, or rather the act of photographing, replaces a sense of imposition. She states that “a camera is sold as a predatory weapon—one that’s as automated as possible, ready to spring” (Sontag 14). She goes on to elaborate how a camera equates to a gun, and uses the example of East African photography where those people hiding in bushes to photograph the wildlife are ever reminiscent of the hunters in days past. What’s important here is the idea of the camera being predatory, which is a topic of conversation in today’s age. The camera is absolutely a tool to peer, as the lens can be interpreted as a forbidden eye. The “wall” through which we see a photograph drops us in the perspective of the photographer, and there are circumstances in which photography can absolutely be violating for the photographed, or as Sontag puts it, “a soft murder” (15).</p>
<p>Although the camera is a weapon and tool of perversion, I strongly believe it can also be something good. Sontag goes on to talk about the role of nostalgia in camera craft, and I agree that photography actively promotes nostalgia. The main reason why we all take photos is to remember the moment, and to seek and share that moment with others. Photography generates a sense of community, one that I cling onto. In my experience, I’ve shared many photographs and have taken more pictures of others than of myself, because it brings me happiness to see those I hold close. I even share the group photos I take with my friends in our chat, so we can all look back and appreciate the moments we were together. All in all, while photography can absolutely be compared to a weapon or a gun, I think the benefits outweigh the negative connotations, though that is not to say the morality cannot be questioned. If taking pictures with my friends is something I enjoy doing, I intend to keep enjoying it.</p>
