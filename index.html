<h1>Saad Ahmed</h1>
<p>Welcome! I am a colorist and editor, and I work creatively in post production.</p>
<p>With experience from both CUNY Hunter College and Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema through Brooklyn College, I've developed a portfolio of post production work that you can examine!</p>

<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<p>I’m Saad Ahmed, and I’m currently studying Film as an Undergraduate student at CUNY Hunter College. The area of film that I’m most interested in is Post, where editing and audio balancing takes place. The films that I create are stories where morals and themes are shown rather than told. Stories where you as an audience member get to unravel what’s happening piece by piece, instead of having the story be handed to you. I’m also a colorist, after learning through Blackmagic’s Davinci Resolve at the Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema with Brooklyn College. The work I do for color is with intentions to bring back some vibrancy I believe was lost over time with certain films. While a lack of color can certainly elicit certain themes, I strongly affirm that the color craft –i.e. the color techniques and strategies implemented by a colorist– showcase creative expression and can encourage the processing of an author’s theme under a different light and perspective.</p>
<p>The purpose of my art is to create narratives that have deep messages and themes with minimal hand holding. As an artist, I’m captivated by storytelling in movies like Inception, and the minute details in animation within movies like Pixar’s Soul. I intend to imply themes, especially for audiences who have their own internal struggle and can find comfort in the relatability of my art. I intend to express messages this way because throughout my childhood, I would play video games that never gave you the full story. Games like The Legend of Zelda would leave me to my own devices to figure out what is happening, and the story would be fragmented. I love those video games, and the films I create are inspired by that type of storytelling, where it’s up to the audience to figure out what’s going on while relating to the themes present in the work.</p>
